## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project has been great practice for using my CSS, but overall this project has helped me to learn how to deploy my own live site through Github. It has made me excited as I feel one step closer to designing and deploying my own sites.

### Continued development

I wish to improve and develop my abilities with CSS layouts and using Github as a tool.
